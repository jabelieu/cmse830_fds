    "Today is all about **learning from each other** in a supportive, informal setting. You'll share your midterm projects with your group, discuss your approaches, and teach each other \"tricks\" that will improve everyone's work. This is **not** a formal critique session - think of it as a collaborative workshop where you help each other succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll gain:**\n",
    "- See diverse approaches to the same assignment\n",
    "- Learn visualization techniques and Streamlit tricks\n",
    "- Get early feedback in a friendly environment\n",
    "- Discover storytelling strategies you hadn't considered\n",
    "- Build a toolkit of ideas to improve your project\n",

I do think I walked away with some style ideas however! After practicing talking about my data sets I realized I left their original names. The names are important for proper attributation of the work but I think I will refer to them as a common name and give thanks explicitly somewhere else. This will peel back a layer of abstraction in the storytelling. I showed the group the navigation page setup I use on the side of the app. It looks nice and is convenient for sorting all the pages."
