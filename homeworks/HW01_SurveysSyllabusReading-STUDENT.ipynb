This section also provides a tone for the rest of the book emphasizing conceptual understanding as opposed to mathematical rigor. The cautionary tales section takes us through a medical diagnosis, governmental resistance schemes, and ‚Äúbroken window‚Äù policing. Each story has a moral linked to topics in the text and are summarized:\n",
