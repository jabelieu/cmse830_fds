    "Your group will turn in one Jupyter notebook that will contain reviews of all five web apps. Those reviews will be mostly in the form of tables. To make things move quickly, I recommend using AI to create markdown tables from information you obtain during the web app review.\n",

    "If there is a major failure of a web app (e.g., the link doesn't work), contact either Max or me immediately.\n",
