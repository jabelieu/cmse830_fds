# README for midterm project
Welcome to my repo container for the semester project in CMSE 830 : Foundations of Data Science! Within this container should be all the necessary items to run the streamlit app code (midterm.py). I recommend this general process to get things going :

* Clone this repo locally.
* Create a virtual environment (example below)
    * python -m venv myenv_name
* Activate the environment and use pip to install the necessary versions of libraries (found in requirements.txt)
    * pip install -r requirements.txt
* Run the script!
    * streamlit run midterm.py
