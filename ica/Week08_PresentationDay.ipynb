    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Today you'll present your midterm project to a **new group** of peers who haven't seen your work before. This fresh perspective is invaluable for identifying blind spots, unclear documentation, and improvement opportunities. You'll also serve as a critical reviewer for your peers, helping them strengthen their projects before final submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** If someone seeing your app for the first time is confused, your documentation needs work. If they can't find features, your interface needs refinement. This is your chance to get honest feedback from users who represent your future audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before Class: What to Prepare\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ Technical Setup\n",
    "- [ ] Ensure your Streamlit app is **deployed and accessible** via URL\n",
    "- [ ] Test your app thoroughly - make sure all features work\n",
    "- [ ] Have your app **open and ready to demo** when class starts\n",
    "- [ ] Bring your laptop if using wall monitors for presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ Presentation Prep\n",
    "- [ ] Prepare talking points for your 8-minute presentation (see structure below)\n",
    "- [ ] Know which features you'll demonstrate\n",
    "- [ ] Identify which rubric requirements you've met\n",
    "- [ ] Be ready to discuss what's working well and what you're still refining\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ Materials to Bring\n",
    "- [ ] Laptop with app running\n",
    "- [ ] Notebook for taking notes on feedback\n",
    "- [ ] This handout for reference\n",

    "- **Groups of 5:** 13 minutes per person (65 minutes total + 10 min discussion)\n",
    "- **Groups of 6:** 12 minutes per person (72 minutes total + discussion as time allows)\n",

    "Structure your presentation to cover these four elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Hook (1 minute)\n",
    "- **What problem are you addressing? What it the question you are trying to answer?** State it clearly in 1-2 sentences\n",
    "- **Why should we care?** What's at stake or what insight will we gain?\n",
    "- **Who is your audience?** (General public? Domain experts? Decision-makers?)\n",

    "- **How did you integrate them?** What challenges did you overcome?\n",
    "- **Key cleaning decisions:** What data quality issues did you handle and why?\n",
    "- **Missing data approach:** What imputation technique did you use and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Live App Demo (4 minutes) ‚≠ê **MOST IMPORTANT**\n",
    "- **Navigate through your app** - show its structure and flow\n",
    "- **Highlight 2-3 key visualizations** - explain what story each tells\n",
    "- **Demonstrate interactive elements** - actually click things, adjust parameters\n",
    "- **Show the narrative** - how do users move through your story?\n",
    "- **Point out documentation** - how do new users know what to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical:** This is a DEMO, not a code review. Show your app in action as if we're potential users, not the code behind it.\n",

    "- **What's working well?** What are you proud of?\n",
    "- **What are you still refining?** Where do you need to improve?\n",
    "- **\"Above and Beyond\" plans?** What extra elements are you considering?"

    "## Guidelines for Effective Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Good Feedback is:\n",
    "- **Specific:** Point to exact elements, not generalities\n",
    "- **Actionable:** Suggest what they could do differently\n",
    "- **Balanced:** Acknowledge strengths while noting improvements\n",
    "- **Empathetic:** Remember you're helping a colleague, not judging them\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Strong Feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Good:** \"Your scatter plot effectively shows correlation, but overlapping points obscure density patterns. Consider adding transparency (alpha=0.5) or trying a 2D histogram to reveal the full distribution.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Good:** \"I love how your sidebar logically groups filters by topic. One confusion: I couldn't tell which tab I was viewing. Maybe highlight the active tab with color or bold text?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Good:** \"Your MICE imputation makes sense for continuous variables. Did you check whether the MCAR assumption holds? A missing data pattern plot on your EDA page might strengthen confidence in your approach.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå Avoid Vague or Unhelpful Feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùå **Too vague:** \"This is good\" *(Not specific or helpful)*\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùå **Not constructive:** \"I don't like the colors\" *(What would be better?)*\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùå **Not helpful:** \"Why didn't you use method X?\" *(Better: \"Method X might work better because...\")*\n",

    "## Tips for Success\n",
    "\n",
    "### As a Presenter:\n",
    "- üéØ **Practice your demo** - know exactly what you'll click and show\n",
    "- üéØ **Focus on WHY, not just WHAT** - explain your reasoning\n",
    "- üéØ **Embrace criticism** - it's your best tool for improvement\n",
    "- üéØ **Be prepared to say \"I don't know\"** - it's better than making up answers\n",
    "\n",
    "### As a Reviewer:\n",
    "- üëÅÔ∏è **Put yourself in a user's shoes** - forget that you're a data scientist\n",
    "- üëÅÔ∏è **Look for the positive** first - build confidence before suggesting changes\n",
    "- üëÅÔ∏è **Be constructive** - every critique should include a potential solution\n",
    "- üëÅÔ∏è **Focus on high-impact items** - not every tiny detail needs mentioning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Management:\n",
    "- ‚è∞ **Designate a timekeeper** in your group\n",
    "- ‚è∞ **Stick to the schedule** - everyone deserves equal time\n",
    "- ‚è∞ **Use a phone timer** - it keeps things fair and on track\n",
